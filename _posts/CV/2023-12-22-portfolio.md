## Accomplishments Without Links

### 1. Peer Counselor Training üå±

I am a peer counselor at the faculty of computer science at the University of Indonesia. I also underwent peer counselor training facilitated by a group of final-year postgraduate students at the faculty of psychology at the University of Indonesia.

Although the certificate is currently in the process of being issued, I have practical experience in peer counseling within my Discord community, the [Intergalactic Science Kingdom](#intergalactic-science-kingdom-isk-).

### 2. Peer Teacher, Intellect, Intelligence Department, and Neuron üöÄ

As a peer teacher at the [Intergalactic Science Kingdom](#intergalactic-science-kingdom-isk-), I conduct weekly English classes, engaging in activities such as book reading, including the Campbell Biology book. Campbell Biology book is a book that is often used by college students to study biology, so you can imagine how challenging the vocabulary can be. I focus on enhancing English fluency, correcting pronunciation, and answering mathematics and physics questions. Initially an intellect for six months, I progressed to roles in the Intelligence Department and Neuron, both superior to the intellect role. In these roles, I recruit new intellects and manage the community for growth and vitality.

### 3. Community Manager üåê

As the Community Manager for the [Universal Flight Group](#universal-flight-group-ufl-%EF%B8%8F) Discord community, my primary responsibility was to facilitate and enhance the collective experience of our members.

This role honed my English proficiency, which is crucial for effective global communication within our international community, and expanded my geographical knowledge as I oversaw virtual flights connecting airports worldwide. Through this experience, I developed a deeper understanding of cross-cultural dynamics and strengthened my skills in fostering a sense of unity among our aviation enthusiasts.

### 4. Dynamic Leadership as a Whatsapp Group Administrator

As a Whatsapp Group Administrator at the [Space Rocket Indonesia](#space-rocket-indonesia-) Community, I oversee daily operations, including regularly locking and unlocking the group. This established routine promotes members' focus and productivity during daylight hours, creating a designated space for community relaxation. Managing interpersonal conflicts is a crucial responsibility, and I also serve as the editor, conducting thorough fact-checking to ensure the community's content meets high-quality standards before publication. My passion for the space rocket industry, driven by a love for orbital mechanics in physics, led me to become deeply engaged with this community.

Moreover, I took the initiative to establish the [ISAC](#isac-%EF%B8%8F) (_Ingin Saya Awali Curhat_) community, earning me the position of group admin. ISAC served as a platform for individuals to seek assistance with their homework, akin to the [Intergalactic Science Kingdom](#intergalactic-science-kingdom-isk-), albeit with the unique feature of being a Whatsapp-based group.
