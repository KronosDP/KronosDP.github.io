## Introduction

Well it's not actually a holiday. Let's just say it's some family business thingy. But yeah, it was on the _lebaran_ holiday so why not call it a holiday right?

At first, I actually told my parents that I don't want to join their holiday on Surabaya because I have lots of homework to do. But actually, after doing one of the homework, it's actually not that much (you'll see that I'm very wrong). Long story short, I reject their proposal that I'll join then to Surabaya to the fact that I'm on a train ride to Surabaya with them.

We used Sembrani Tambahan train at midnight. . We departed from Gambir stasion, Jakarta at midnight. It was the perfect time because we can sleep while we're on the train. Also the babies and kids doesn't cry because it's midnight and it's their time to sleep. I'd recommend you guys to ride train at night for that very reason. Also, another interesting thing is that the train was full but most people left when we passed Semarang. I think most people just want to go to Semarang after all :D

## Closing Statements

Oh well, I forget to continue this post. I've already forgotten what did I do on Surabaya. One thing for sure was that I ate doner kebab and wen to pak soleh. Well... maybe a story for another time huh?

p.s. I went to taman ghanjaran.
