## Introduction

This is the story of my adventure when I went to Bandung. Some things happened there, so I want to tell you about it.

## The Journey

My family and I went to Gambir station early in the morning (actually not that early because our train was not that early). There, we ride the Argo Parahyangan to Bandung. It was a beautiful Sunday morning. Before going to Bandung, we ate breakfast at McDonald's at Gambir station. Because it was still under 11 am, McDonald's was still serving the breakfast menu. I ate big breakfast menu there.

After a fulfilling breakfast, we rode the train to Bandung. On the way to Bandung, I interviewed for the Sobat Curhat position at @rentangjiwa\_. Surprisingly, I got accepted for that position. To this day, I want to understand why I got accepted for a position with minimum requirements for undergraduate psychology students. But oh well, that's that, right? Anyway, let's continue the story about the train ride.

I sat in a seat facing opposite the train's travel direction. It may be dizzying for some people, but for me, it wasn't. I enjoyed every bit of that train ride. I listened to many hymns on my Spotify. It was amazing. Seeing many beautiful views on the way proves that my God is an amazing God who created this beautiful world. That's one way to see it.

## First Step on Bandung

When my family and I arrived in Bandung, we were starving. We dropped our bags at the hotel, checked in, and found the nearest restaurant on Braga Street. The food in the restaurant was not recommended. It wasn't tasty, and it was expensive.

## The Drama

Later that day, we went to the church. We went to GPIB Bethel for church. It was a small and simple church. The sermon was great to start the year. I love it. The only thing that I hated that day was that I had an ulcer and had the urge to poop so badly. That was the situation at that time. After the Sunday service, I ran to my hotel. It was a 10-minute walk that was very tortuous. But I told myself, "I can do it; just calm down, and everything's gonna be alright. Eventually, you'll arrive at the hotel; just chill out". I said that over and over again, and I arrived at the hotel and pooped as much as I could. That was an unforgettable day, not because of the poop drama but because that day reminded me that no matter how hard the situation, you'll get over it eventually.

## The Day After the Drama

After that day, I got terrible news about my Data Structure and Algorithm score. My score was 53.33, which is below 55, the passing grade. It was heartbreaking knowing that I never failed any class. Little did I know that I got a chance to take the remedial course. Anyway, I rode Bandros, or Bandung Tour on the Bus later that day. It was definitely worth the money, considering it was a 40-ish minute city tour with its own tour guide.

After that, we went to Factory Outlet, and I met my friend at a mall that I forgot the name of (not my friend, the mall!).
