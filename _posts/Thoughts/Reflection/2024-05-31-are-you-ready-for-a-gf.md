## Introduction

I am a person that can get lost in his feelings easily if it's a hard feeling. Sometimes I just don't realise it but bam! Those romantic feelings that I have for somebody can consume me.

It's actually pretty good if I can control it. The problem is that I can't. I have this obsessive and compulsive behavior to someone ofentime. My obsessive behave come from the fact that I put her on top of my priority list all the time. It's bad because I have other things to do. Also, I have to remember that God should be the focus of my life.

My compulsive behavior came from the fact that I always need to check out my phone to check if she already replied to my message. It's actually not that bad if I can control it. The problem is that I can't control it. I always have the urge to check out my phone for like every 2 minutes of my live to check that she already reply to my message or not. These kind of compulsive behavior can drive a girl crazy even if she's already falling in love with me deeply.

## The Protocol

To adress this issue, I want to write this blog! I want to make a protocol that I can read so that I will not become obsessive and compulsive towards a girl. This protocol will be ran if I found a girl that I like. **_This protocol should be done before you ask her out to be your gf_**. The protocol is basically divided into 2 category which is my own filter and God's will. **_First, let's talk about my own filter, which my criteria_**.

- **_Check if she enable you to be more productive to do God's will_**. In this case God's will for me to do. It can be to teach, do counseling, programming, and what **_God want's me to do_**. This is pretty ambigous tho. Because I can't know for sure what God's will for me is. I can't say that God's will the thing that I am mastering on because sometimes it's the hard thing that God wants me to do. On the other hand, it can be the easy simple thing that God wants me to do. There is not a way of surely knowing what God's will for me but I'm pretty sure that God will show me the way.

- **_You're also helping her achive of what God want her to do_**. It's actually the same case with the above point, it's just me doing it to her.

- **_Check for my own obsesive and compulsive behaviour towards her_**. This is important because you don't want to make the same mistake such that a person gets your obsessive and compulsive treatment right? This can be checked by seeing how much you're prioritizing her. Always remember that **_she is not on top of your priority list_**. Please do treat her with space for her to grow. Also, trust that God will keep her safe wherever she is. But, if she's not dressed modestly, she's not the one. That is not negotiable. If you're dealing with the case where she is already close to you but you're giving your obsessive and compulsive behavior again, please do search help. Please realize that **_she is not on top your priority list_**. If you can't do it, **_look up for help_**.

The next thing that I can do pipeliningly while doing my filter (that I mentioned above) is to do these things:

- **_Pray_**. It's not a hard thing to do but I often forget it. You should ask God if she's really the one. The answer from God can be one of these points: `yes, yes and wait, no because I have something better for you`. Either ways, the only solution for me to know what God really want me to do is pray everyday to ask him for the answer and also wait for God's time. You should ask God if she's His will or not.

## Ending

If I were about to say: _this list/protocol could change, would you see it as a loop hole?_ Probably yes. That's why I won't say it. The fact is that this is a fixed list for checking if she's the right person or not. This list could be added tho. Best luck for you.
