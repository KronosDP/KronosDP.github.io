## Background Story

I've been watching Wirtual, a trackmania youtuber grinding a tower map. This is hard to do. He spend hundreds of hour hunting this map. And he fall everytime. This is depressing for him. The question is should he quit? Well, he made his video already so check it out if (you want to)[https://youtu.be/CxCzLV1pyUs?si=G3mBa8NIgQyvKAYk].

## Is it Tho?

`Is it Logical to Quit?` is the question that I sometime ask myself. Sometimes, I just get tired working on the things that I do. Seriously, it can be tiring to have that _I will not quit_ or _never give up_ mentality. So, in this blog I want to write to further formalize when I think people should stop doing the thing that they're doing.

One of the thing that you should check is if that what you're doing will ever get something in return. We often do thing to get something in return right? It would be useless if you persevere and get nothing.

I know that someone will say that, "when you persevere and get nothing, you're not really getting nothing. You're getting something". Well, yeah, sure. But in this case, maybe it's more logical to stop doing the thing you're doing and focus on other things, don't you think? Maybe the time is just not right. This is the case why Wirtual stopped grinding deep dip 2. But I believe that he'll return and finish it, but only if the mapper finished the practice floor. This makes so much more sense since you're trying to wait for the right time to start your grind.

## Closing Remarks

I'm not really talking about trackmania here. I'm talking about live in general. Maybe it's about your work, relationship, or other important things in your life, sometimes you gotta stop and try to take a step back. It'll work out at the end. Just believe in yourself. Yes, maybe it's logical to take a step back and consider your option at the moment.
