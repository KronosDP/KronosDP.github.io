This is a blog post that I made during my midterm moments on my third semester as a computer science student at the University of Indonesia. I was inspired by one of my lecturers to build this website. He linked Jekyll tutorial by [Girrafe Academy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB) on his website (Girrafe Academy, n.d.). At the same time, I was feeling burnout by doing all my course at campus, so that's why I'm building this post, I suppose to vent out everything that's on my mind. Hope you like it and maybe this blog can be an inspiration for you.

You can study more about Jekyll [here](https://jekyllrb.com/). Also, currently I'm using the Minima theme. You can study Jekyll by doing Google Sana Google Sini (GSGS), a popular term on our college class that's written our our [Operating System course website]('https://os.vlsm.org/').

Lastly, I want to talk about my [My GitHub Page](https://github.com/KronosDP). I don't know, maybe you're intersted to see the code to this blog.

p.s. I know that my grammar is all over the place. I am really sorry for all the gramatical error that I made on my writings. I hope that you can forgive me. Also, I am using English because I can't write something in a _gaya yang tidak baku_ in bahasa Indonesia. But anyways, this is my blog, so I can do anything that I want hehehe :D
