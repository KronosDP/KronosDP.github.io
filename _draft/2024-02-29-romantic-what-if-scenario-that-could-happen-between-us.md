## Motivation

Let's be real, you've felt a romantic feeling in some way or another but you don't know how to feel that again. Maybe you've broken up, or maybe you don't have the courage to say the fact that you liked him/her when you had the chance. This is my take on those things. These are some of ChatGPT finest output on the question: `"give me a "what if" scenarios that keeps you at night"`. Also, here are my answer to those questions

## The What If Scenarios

### What if I hadn't ended things with my ex? Would we have been able to work through our issues and find happiness together?

### What if I had confessed my feelings to my crush sooner? Would they have reciprocated, or was I just building up false hope?

### What if I had chosen a different time to propose to my partner? Would they have said yes, or was I rushing things?

### What if I had prioritized my relationship over my career? Would we still be together, or was the timing just not right?

###  What if I had tried harder to make things work with my long-distance partner? Could we have bridged the gap and built a future together?

###  What if I had been more spontaneous in my relationship? Would it have kept the spark alive, or was stability what we really needed?

###  What if I had forgiven my partner for their mistake? Could we have moved past it and rebuilt trust, or was it a deal-breaker?

###  What if I had been more vocal about my needs and desires in the relationship? Could we have avoided the misunderstandings and arguments?

###  What if I had taken a chance on dating someone outside of my usual type? Could they have surprised me and been exactly what I needed?

###  What if I had been more attentive to the signs that my partner was losing interest? Could I have salvaged the relationship before it was too late?

###  What if I had been more open-minded about my partner's hobbies and interests? Could we have found common ground and grown closer?

###  What if I had given my ex another chance when they begged for reconciliation? Could we have learned from our mistakes and built a stronger relationship?

###  What if I had been more proactive in planning romantic gestures for my partner? Could it have reignited the passion and excitement in our relationship?

###  What if I had let go of my fear of rejection and approached that person I'm interested in? Could it have led to a beautiful connection, or would I have faced disappointment?
